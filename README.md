# Weekend-Challenge-1

## Objective
- This application has an input form that collects an employee's first name,
  last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary.
- There is a 'Submit' button that collects the form information, stores the
  information and calculates monthly costs, appending the information to the
  DOM and clears the input fields. Using the stored information, the button 
  will calculate monthly costs and append this to the DOM. If the total monthly 
  cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color is added to the total monthly cost.

- There is a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM.
